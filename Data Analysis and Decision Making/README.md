# What Affects Life Expectancy
This is the project of [MBC638 Data Analysis and Decision Making course](https://github.com/harper-he/Excel/tree/master/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Decision%20Making#data-analysis-and-decision-making-course-info) (fall 2018 semester)
## Project Intro
This project will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to improve the life expectancy of its population
### Methods Used
* Pivot tables/charts
* 3D maps 
* time series plots
* descriptive statistics
* Scatterplots
* correlation analysis
* multiple regression analysis （include Numerical, Dummy and Interaction variables)
* Coefficients
* p-values (these will be discussed later during the semester)
* Predictions/forecasting
### Technologies
Excel
StatTools
## Project Description
THIS PROJECT CONSISTS OF 2 MAIN PARTS
### Part A: Descriptive analysis of variables.
1. Provide an explanation of how the data was collected. 
2. Explain the population of interest.
3. Describe each of the variables, including (i) graphical and (ii) numerical descriptive techniques , (iii) Pivot tables/charts. 
4.For qualitative variables, discuss the difference in descriptive statistics across groups using Pivot charts/tables.
5. Briefly summarize your overall findings.
###  Part B: Analysis of association between variables.
1. Choose one or two dependent variable(s) (Y-variable(s)), choose three or five variables as the explanatory variables (X-variables).
2. Explain why and how we expect the explanatory variables to explain/predict the dependent variable(s). 
3. Scatterplots and correlation analysis: 
• Create scatterplots for each of the dependent variables paired with relevant explanatory variables. 
• Conduct corresponding correlation analysis and discuss the results.
• Compare the results with our predictions
4. Conduct a multiple regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between the dependent variables and explanatory variables. The models must include as explanatory variables:
• Numerical variables (continuous)
• Dummy variable(s)
• Interaction variable(s)
5. give full interpretations to the following:
• Coefficients
• p-values (these will be discussed later during the semester)
• Evaluate the overall model
• Predictions/forecasting.
6. Conclusions. Summarize findings and discuss the business/economic implications of our statistical results. 

# Data Analysis and Decision Making Course Info
## Course Objectives
The aim of this course is to learn essential concepts of **data analysis**, **probability**,
and **statistics** necessary to understand and perform analysis of business and economic data.

## Course Topics: 
Sample descriptive methods|graphical, tabular, and numerical; correlation and asso-
ciation; probability; Normal distribution; Central Limit Theorem and sampling distributions; condence
intervals; hypothesis testing; multivariate analysis with continuous and categorical variables (OLS and
Logistic regressions); time series modeling and forecasting; Monte Carlo simulation and other special
topics (if time permits).

## Learning Objectives:
1. create and interpret various **descriptive statistics** for business data, including graphs, tables, and numerical measures.
2. reate and interpret **confidence intervals** and **hypothesis testing** for population mean and proportions.
3. create and interpret **regression models** (OLS and Logistic) using business data.
4. perform **time series** and **forecasting analysis** of business data.

## Software : 
Excel and Palisade's StatTools add-in for Excel.
